Gauntlet port for the Colour Maximite 2
(I RECOMMEND YOU USE THE LAST BETA FIRMWARE FOR CMM2)

This is a version of Gauntlet to Colour Maximite 2.
I don´t own any rights about Gauntlet trademark, this is only a homebrew project made by me in my free time, and for sure in the current state, it has lots of bugs.
Keep in mind I´m only a Gauntlet fan with some basic developing skills and my target is only to challenge myself to port it to CMM2, it´s not a project with profit intentions.
